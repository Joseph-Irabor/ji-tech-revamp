Mr. Joseph Irabor is an outstanding and admirable mentor to me. He has a knack for encouraging me, yet at the same time challenging me enough to push me out of my comfort zone. 





I have always enjoyed and still enjoy the time I spend with him, whether its a lecture or even just a normal conversation. Every interaction with Mr Irabor is always a favourable and valuable one. Overall, he is an extra-ordinary person, with a vast amount of knowledge and an incredible heart/attitude towards life and the people around him, and anyone will be lucky to have him as a mentor/teacher.

When I first met Mr Irabor Joseph, I was at the early stage of deciding a career path for my life in the computing feild and I was still very much confused and not clear on the path to choose. Mr Irabor introduced me to all there was to know about the different computing fields and helped me to realize and choose the one I had the most passion for. After a few months of learning and being mentored under Mr Irabor, I was able to confidently choose a career path for myself and grow in it.

Mr. Irabor Joseph is an amazing and honorable tutor, who teaches with enthusiasm and he is always ready to help and share his knowledge. He encourages me to practice more and worry less, this principle has greatly improved my confidence in programming and in my daily life. 

Apart from pursuing a bachelor's degree in Pharmacy, I also found interest in programming, and now that I am happily learning programming and web development. I am confident I will build my own website and become a front-end developer. All thanks to Mr. Irabor Joseph
