Mr. Joseph Irabor is an outstanding and admirable mentor to me. He has a knack for encouraging me, yet at the same time challenging me enough to push me out of my comfort zone.
When I first met Mr. Joseph, I was at the early stage of deciding on a career path for my life in the computing field and I was still very much confused and not clear on the path to choose. He introduced me to all there was to know about the different computing fields and helped me to realize and choose the one I had the most passion for. After a few months of learning and being mentored under him, I was able to confidently choose a career path for myself and grow in it.




I have always enjoyed and still enjoy the time I spend with him, whether its a lecture or even just a normal conversation. Every interaction with Mr Irabor is always a favourable and valuable one. Overall, he is an extra-ordinary person, with a vast amount of knowledge and an incredible heart/attitude towards life and the people around him, and anyone will be lucky to have him as a mentor/teacher.
